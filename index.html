        Iceland is a country of extreme geological contrasts. Widely known as
        “The Land of Fire and Ice” Iceland is home to some of the largest
        glaciers in Europe, and some of the world’s most active volcanoes.
        Iceland is also the land of light and darkness. Long summer days with
        near 24-hours of sunshine are offset by short winter days with only a
        few hours of daylight.

      <h3>Iceland is not a destination. It is an adventure.</h3>
      <p>
        Iceland remains largely uninhabited, with more than half of its 320.000
        inhabitants living in the capital city. In fact, a mere twenty minute
        drive from Reykjavik center takes you out of the hubbub of city life and
        into the seclution of Iceland's spectacular landscapes, which
        inspireadventures from its shores to its mountain tops. But the
        landscape is not just for gaping at; Iceland's rivers are perfect for
        rafting, fishing, diving and snorkeling; its mountains, volcanoes and
        glaciers are good for hiking, climbing, dog-sledding, and snowmobiling;
        its snowy hills for skiing and snowboarding; its waves for surfing; its
        caves for exploring; and its barren highlands for jeep safaris.

      <h3>The Land of Giants</h3>
      <p>
        With almost 80% of the country uninhabited, much of Iceland's terrain
        consists of plateaux, mountain peaks, and fertile lowlands. There are
        many long, deep fjords and glaciers, including Europe's largest,
        Vatnajökull. The landscape is characterized by waterfalls, geysers,
        volcanoes, black sand beaches, and otherworldly steaming lava fields.
        Fjaðrárgljúfur is a magnificent and massive canyon, about 100 meters
        deep and about two kilometres long. The canyon has sheer walls, and is
        somewhat serpentine and narrow. The bedrock in Fjaðrárgljúfur is mostly
        palagonite from cold periods of the Ice Age and is thought to be about
        two million years old.

      <h3>The land of <span id="light">light</span> and darkness</h3>
      <p>
        Iceland is home to the largest glaciers in Europe, as well as some of
        the world's most active volcanoes. It is widely known as "The Land of
        Fire and Ice". But Iceland escapes definition. It is also the land of
        light and darkness. Its location, just below the Arctic Circle, makes
        for long summer days with near 24-hours of sunlight; offset by short
        winter days with very little sunlight at all. Fortunately, while winters
        in Iceland are dark, they are relatively mild and play host to one of
        nature's most spectacular exhibitions of beauty; the Aurora Borealis.
